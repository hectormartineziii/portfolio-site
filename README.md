My website, [www.hectormartineziii.com](http://www.hectormartineziii.com), is built with express.js as the backend server and hosted on Heroku. The front end is built with basic html/css and using the bootstrap library.

Future improvements:

In the future I plan to do more templating with mustache or jade or handlebars.
