  <h2>hello world of blogs</h2>
  <p>I've finally created my own website from scratch. Well, with the help of Twitter's Bootstrap. The homepage includes to stock photos I bought from <a href='http://www.123rf.com'>123rf.com</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm going to be blogging about books I've read, thoughts on design, business, society and other stuff. </br></br></p>
