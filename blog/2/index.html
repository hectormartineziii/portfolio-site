  <h2>Coding bootcamp scholarship application essay</h2>
  <p>Hello again! For the past few weeks I've been applying to coding bootcamps, I've met with mentors to discuss which bootcamps to choose and wha to look for in a bootcamp. Meeting with mentors has been a huge confidence boost. I've been told I don't quite need a bootcamp to get a job in tech. However, I am doing it because I want to gain a more architectural understanding of how web apps are put together. Something I wouldn't quite learn unless I worked or made my own startup.</br></br>
  Anywho, during my applications I've also applied for scholarships. For this particular scholarship I was asked "What is the secret to having a successful career in today's world economy?"</br></br>
  Here's my response:</br></br>
  In today’s fast-paced and global economy, it is essential to consistently reassess one’s skill set. Many people make the mistake of focusing on simply obtaining new titles or job-level promotions. If those titles and promotions don’t come with learning opportunities, however, a person’s skills will stagnate or even become obsolete.</br></br>For example, in the early 2000s, Flash websites were ubiquitous. This changed when Apple mobile devices stopped supporting Flash. Steve Jobs made the argument in his 2010 “Thoughts on Flash” article that Flash was not well suited for browsing websites on mobile devices. And, as he predicted, there has been a marked decline in the use of Flash for websites other than for gaming sites and delivering video content. What happened to those Flash/Flex coders? Luckily there was an alternative at the time for those willing to reassess their skill sets and to learn new skills. Flash developers were able to adopt JavaScript and develop highly interactive websites with the use of jQuery and with frameworks such as Ember, Angular, and Backbone for more complex client-side applications.</br></br>I have reached a point in my career where I am reassessing my skills. I have been learning from meet-ups, self-study, and projects in the open-source community. I believe acquiring the LAMP, MEAN, and Rails stack will not just put me at an advantage because of the breadth of the curriculum, but also because it will allow me to continue to follow emergent trends, have the skills to pick them up, and give myself a better chance to be successful in today's world economy. </br></br>- 07/26/15</p>
