  <h2>What happens when your skill set stagnates</h2>
  <p>In today’s fast-paced and global economy, it is essential to consistently reassess one’s skill set. Many people make the mistake of focusing on simply obtaining new titles or job-level promotions. If those titles and promotions don’t come with learning opportunities, however, a person’s skills will stagnate or even become obsolete.</br></br>For example, in the early 2000s, Flash websites were ubiquitous. This changed when Apple mobile devices stopped supporting Flash. Steve Jobs made the argument in his 2010 “Thoughts on Flash” article that Flash was not well suited for browsing websites on mobile devices. And, as he predicted, there has been a marked decline in the use of Flash for websites other than for gaming sites and delivering video content. What happened to those Flash/Flex coders? Luckily there was an alternative at the time for those willing to reassess their skill sets and to learn new skills. Flash developers were able to adopt JavaScript and develop highly interactive websites with the use of jQuery and with frameworks such as Ember, Angular, and Backbone for more complex client-side applications.</br></br>I have reached a point in my career where I am reassessing my skills. I have been learning from meet-ups, self-study, and projects in the open-source community. I believe learning the LAMP, MEAN, and Rails provides developers a good foundation for web development in terms of breadth. I for one, will continue to be aware of emerging trends to pick up new critical skills as they arise, and give myself a better chance to be successful in today's world economy. </br></br></p>
